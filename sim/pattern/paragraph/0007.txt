The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is the Federal Information Processing
Standard for symmetric encryption, and it is defined by FIPS Publication #197 (2001).
From the cryptographic perspective, AES is widely believed to be secure and efficient,
and is therefore broadly accepted as the standard for both government and industry
applications. In fact, almost any new protocol requiring symmetric encryption supports
AES, and many existing systems that were originally designed with other symmetric
encryption algorithms are being converted to AES. Given the popularity of AES and its
expected long term importance, improving AES performance and security has significant
benefits for the PC client and server platforms.
