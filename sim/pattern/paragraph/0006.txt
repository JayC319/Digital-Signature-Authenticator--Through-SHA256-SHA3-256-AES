AES, or Advanced Encryption Standard, is a block cipher that encrypts blocks of data in 128 bits. To encrypt anything larger than 128 bits, AES uses a block cipher mode. There are many different AES block cipher modes that are part of the AES specification. The simplest block cipher mode is Electronic Code Book (ECB). Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) addresses security weaknesses with ECB and is one of the most common modes used in portable encrypting Flash drives. XTS is one of the newest modes and provides stronger data protection over ECB and CBC. The following is a brief description of these block cipher modes.
Electronic Code Book (ECB). This cipher mode simply repeats the AES encryption process for each 128-bit block of data. Figure 1 depicts data encryption using ECB mode. Each block is independently encrypted using AES with the same encryption key. For decryption, the process is reversed. With ECB, identical blocks of unencrypted data, referred to as plain text, are encrypted the same way and will yield identical blocks of encrypted data (cipher text). This cipher mode is not ideal since it does not hide data patterns well. Figure 2 is an example that demonstrates the major security vulnerability with this cipher mode.
The unencrypted image is shown on the left. The image on the right shows what the cipher text might look like when using other encryption modes such as CBC or XTS. The center image clearly demonstrates the vulnerability associated with ECB. Since identical image pixel patterns within the encryption block are encrypted in such a manner that they yield identical cipher blocks, the original image bleeds through.
Clearly, identical blocks of data should not be encrypted in a manner that yields the same cipher text. As a result, the ECB block cipher mode is considered weak security and is not recommended for use.
